# Lab Assignments

This is my self-study solutions to the lab assignements from CMU [15-213](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/).
Each lab is self-contained in its handout folder. Original handouts can be downloaded from CS:APP3e website, which I included in archive folder as backup.

## Data Lab

Students implement simple logical, two's complement, and floating point functions, but using a highly restricted subset of C.
For example, they might be asked to compute the absolute value of a number using only bit-level operations and straightline code.
This lab helps students understand the bit-level representations of C data types and the bit-level behavior of the operations on data.
